# Demographic Dynamics of Addiction
## Final project for QMSS 201: Intro to Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences

As per the Oxford Dictionary, addiction is defined as “the condition of being unable to stop using or doing something as a habit, especially something harmful”. It affects a vast amount of people worldwide and can have detrimental effects on one’s physical and mental health and overall quality of life. Breaking out of addiction involves a multitude of psychological, physiological, and social factors including seeking treatment, lifestyle changes, and building a strong support system to help aid them through changing these harmful patterns.
This report aims to investigate some issues around alcohol and cigarette addiction. Our research questions are:

- How does addiction vary by different demographics?
- Does the willingness to stop addiction help in stopping it?
  
The data utilized for this project is sourced from the 2016 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) collected by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration (SAMHSA). It contains responses to questions regarding respondents’ demographic information and addiction habits.
